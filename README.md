# 🎬 Assignment: Bringing Web Pages to Life with CSS & JavaScript

In this assignment, you’ll create a visually dynamic and interactive experience by combining the beauty of **CSS3 animations** with the logic and power of **JavaScript functions**. By the end, you’ll have a mini interactive experience that not only looks good—but *feels* responsive and alive!

---

## 🎨✨ Part 1: CSS3 Transitions and Animations for Dynamic Styling Effects

Start by enhancing elements on your page using **CSS transitions** and **keyframe animations**. You can animate things like:

* Button hover effects
* Smooth fades, slides, or transforms
* Continuous or triggered animations using `@keyframes`

**Goal:** Create a page that visually responds to user interaction and/or time-based triggers using only CSS.

---

## 📚✨ Part 2: JavaScript Functions — Scope, Parameters & Return Values

Now it’s time to dive deeper into how **functions** actually work. In this section:

* Write several custom functions that take in **parameters** and return **useful values**
* Demonstrate understanding of **local vs global scope**
* Show how functions can be reused to control animation, trigger DOM changes, or calculate values

**Goal:** Show functional thinking by building small, reusable pieces of logic that clearly use parameters, return values, and demonstrate scope awareness.

---

## 🎨🎬 Part 3: Combining CSS Animations with JavaScript

Here’s the real magic—combine the two worlds!

Use JavaScript to **trigger** CSS animations dynamically. Think along the lines of:

* A button that animates a box when clicked
* A card flip animation on hover or click
* A loading animation that starts/stops based on user input
* A popup/modal that slides in and fades out based on events

**Goal:** Use JavaScript to **add/remove classes** or modify styles dynamically to trigger CSS animations. Bonus if you make it reusable with functions!

---

## Deliverables

Submit a project folder that includes:

* `index.html` — Your structured content
* `styles.css` — All your transitions and keyframe animations
* `script.js` — Your functional logic demonstrating scope, parameters, return values, and animation triggers

Each part of the assignment should be clearly labeled and commented to show your understanding.

---

## Outcome

You’ll be evaluated on:

* Use of CSS transitions and animations to enhance UI
* Quality and clarity of JavaScript functions (with parameters and return values)
* Effective integration of CSS and JS for interactive effects
* Code readability, modularity, and documentation
* Creativity and user experience

# 📘 Student README – Healthy Habits Tracker

## 👩‍🎓 Student Overview
This project is my submission for the assignment **“Bringing Web Pages to Life with CSS & JavaScript.”**  
I created a **Healthy Habits Tracker** web app where users can log water intake, visualize progress with a filling glass, and receive motivational health tips.

---

## 📂 Project Structure
```
/plp-webtechnologies-classroom-july2025-july-2025-css3-transitions-animations-CSS3-Transitions-Animat
  ├── index.html   → Main page content & structure
  ├── styles.css   → CSS transitions, hover effects & keyframe animations
  └── script.js    → JavaScript functions, scope, return values, and animation triggers
```

---

## 🎨 Part 1: CSS3 Transitions and Animations
- **Hover Effects:** The “Drink Water” button enlarges smoothly on hover.  
- **Transitions:** The glass fills with a smooth rising effect when cups are added.  
- **Keyframes:** Health tips fade in with an animated slide effect.  

✅ This demonstrates **visual responses to interaction and time-based triggers** using only CSS.

---

## ⚡ Part 2: JavaScript Functions (Scope, Parameters, Return Values)
- **`addCup(amount)`** → Takes a parameter, returns a new total (shows parameters & return values).  
- **`updateGlass(newTotal)`** → Uses scope (global vs local variables) to update the DOM.  
- **`showMessage(cups)`** → Displays different feedback based on input.  
- **`getRandomTip()` & `showTip()`** → Returns a random health tip and triggers CSS animation.  

✅ This demonstrates **functional thinking, scope awareness, and reusability**.

---

## 🎬 Part 3: Combining CSS with JavaScript
- JavaScript dynamically **adds/removes classes** (`fade`) to trigger CSS animations.  
- The water button **triggers the glass filling animation** via JS style updates.  
- The reset button clears the animations and resets state.  
- Button is **disabled by JS** when daily water goal is reached (extra interaction).  

✅ This demonstrates **integration of CSS and JS for interactive effects**.

---

## 📦 Deliverables
- **index.html:** Semantic structure with buttons, water glass, and message areas.  
- **styles.css:** Transitions, hover effects, and `@keyframes` animations.  
- **script.js:** Functions with parameters, scope, and return values + DOM + CSS control.  
- **README.md (this file):** Documentation for clarity.  

---

## 🏆 Outcome
This project meets the assignment goals by:  
- Enhancing UI with **CSS animations**.  
- Demonstrating **JavaScript function logic** with scope, parameters, and return values.  
- Combining CSS and JavaScript to build an **interactive, user-friendly experience**.  
- Ensuring **modularity, readability, and documentation** through clean code and comments.

✨ *This project not only fulfills the technical requirements but also promotes healthy living by encouraging users to drink water and adopt positive daily habits.*
